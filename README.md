# Fashion_mninst_image_classification
  In this project, I created image classification using feed forward network on fashion mnist data which I have implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Installation

To run the web app on your local computer, install the required libraries, These packages are included in requirement.txt. In this project used Python3.8.0.
Run the following command in terminal to install the required packages.<br><br>
`pip install -r requirement.txt` <br><br>
or<br><br>
if you use jupyter notebook run the following command in anaconda prompt terminal to install the required packages.<br><br>

`conda install --file requirements.txt`
<br>
<br>

## Getting Started

We create model for image classification using feed forward network. The feed forward network is first and simple type of deep learning networks. It is a classification algorithm. In this network, information moves only forward not from a cycle.
